# Image Classifier Project
Two part Image Classifier Project

- Part 1 - Develop an Image Classifier with Deep Learning
- Part 2 - Build a command line application to utilize the Image Classifier
  - this utilizes a `train.py` script to train the network and save the model in a checkpoint.pth file
  - and a `predict.py` script to use load the trained network to predict the class for an image
